        <p style="font-size:13px;"><strong>All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our conference are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting
            cooperation from all
            participants to
            help ensure a safe environment for everybody.</strong></p>
        <p class="legal-text justified" style="font-size:13px;">We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Conference participants violating these rules will be warned and may be expelled from the venue without a refund.
          The conference may also
          escalate
          and contact local authorities
          depending on the nature and severity of the violation. Harassment includes offensive comments (verbal or otherwise) related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size,
          race,
          ethnicity, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual
          attention.
          Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, social media.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="legal-text justified" style="font-size:13px;"> Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Sponsors and volunteers are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors
          should not use sexualised
          images,
          offensive clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a discriminatory environment.
          If a participant engages
          in harassing behavior, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being
          harassed,
          or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified as they'll be wearing branded t-shirts. Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue
          security
          or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance. We expect participants to follow these rules at the conference venue as
          well
          as any conference-related social events.</p>
