                GNU social projects, which power both the nascent music community, Libre.fm and pioneered the federated social networking community that has since exploded due to Mastodon. Since the FSF, Matt ran technology at Creative Commons for a
                few
                years and was an early employee at GitLab. In 2017, he worked on the W3C's Web Platform Tests project. Most recently he has been traveling the world, meeting free and open source software developers and through the Handshake project
                giving

                Jin L.C. Guo is an Assistant Professor in the School of Computer Science at McGill University. She received her Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Notre Dame. Her research interests lie in the
                interdisciplinary area
                of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence, and specialize in software traceability. Her work aims to facilitate automated SE tasks such as context-aware information retrieval and project Q&A. Her recent research focuses on
                dynamically
                constructing connections between heterogenous software artifacts, mining domain knowledge from those artifacts, and making inference about the semantics of artifact connections.
